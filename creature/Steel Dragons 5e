Here they establish deep-cover identities as information brokers, sages, patrons of the arts, and other professions that give them ready access to the lore and culture of the people with whom they’ve chosen to make their home. By comparison, their secondary lair acts as a sort of “summer house” that they visit only occasionally, such as for breeding or child-rearing. Few cities in the multiverse can boast more than one or two steel dragons among its populace. However, they guard their true identities so cautiously that there’s no real way of knowing whether any given grey-haired aristocrat or scholar is a steel dragon in disguise."

By comparison, their secondary lair acts as a sort of “summer house” that they visit only occasionally, such as for breeding or child-rearing.
